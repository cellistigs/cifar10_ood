# Github repository to host code and data corresponding to OOD datasets for CIFAR 10 in a standardized, pytorch dataloader compatible format.
 
## CIFAR10-1 
We host wrapper code for https://github.com/modestyachts/CIFAR-10.1 in this repo. Code will call a download command from that repo. 

## CINIC-10 (imagenet only)
We host data and code for the imagenet-derived portion of cinic-10 only in this repo. All credit for dataset curation and extraction of imagenet examples goes to: https://github.com/BayesWatch/cinic-10

## STL-10 (coming soon)

## CIFAR10-C (coming soon)
